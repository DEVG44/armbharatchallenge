ROAD AI SYSTEM – TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
------------------
Road AI is an embedded AI-based object detection system designed for real-time road monitoring and driver assistance. The system detects potholes and other obstacles and provides hardware-based alerts.

2. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
----------------------
The model was trained on Kaggle using a Tesla P100 GPU. A large aggregated dataset of approximately 55,000 images was curated from multiple sources including recommended datasets and Roboflow collections.

The dataset was divided into six balanced classes:
- POTHOLE
- PERSON
- ANIMAL
- VEHICLE
- OBSTACLE
- CRACK

Training was conducted for over 100 epochs across multiple experimental runs. Early weaker models were iteratively improved by expanding dataset diversity and refining annotations.

Final validation metrics:
- Validation Images: 10,959
- mAP50: 0.72
- mAP50-95: 0.446
- Precision: 0.771
- Recall: 0.637

3. MODEL CONVERSION PIPELINE
-----------------------------
After training, the best model (best.pt) underwent structured conversion:

Step 1: PyTorch (best.pt)
Step 2: Export to ONNX
Step 3: Convert to TensorFlow SavedModel
Step 4: Apply INT8 Quantization
Step 5: Deploy best_int8.tflite to Raspberry Pi 5

Final model size:
- SavedModel: 31.9 MB
- INT8 TFLite: 2.7 MB

This conversion ensured:
- Reduced memory usage
- Faster inference
- ARM compatibility
- Stable embedded deployment

4. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
------------------------
The system operates in a continuous loop:

- Capture frame from USB webcam
- Run inference using YOLO INT8 model
- Process detections
- Smooth bounding boxes
- Smooth confidence values
- Activate GPIO outputs
- Update OLED display
- Log high-confidence images
- Display annotated frame

Multi-threading is used for:
- OLED display updates
- Asynchronous image saving

This prevents blocking operations and maintains stable FPS.

5. HARDWARE INTERFACING
-----------------------
Each detected class is mapped to a dedicated GPIO pin controlling an LED.

POTHOLE detection additionally activates a buzzer for 0.5 seconds.

OLED display shows:
- Detected class label
- Confidence percentage

The system also monitors CPU temperature and displays FPS for performance tracking.

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------
- INT8 quantization for reduced computation
- Bounding box smoothing to reduce flickering
- Confidence smoothing to stabilize display values
- Asynchronous logging to avoid frame drops
- ARM-compatible deployment
- GPU-trained model optimized for edge inference

7. PROJECT OBJECTIVES FULFILLED
--------------------------------
- Real-time pothole detection
- Multi-class road obstacle detection
- Visual feedback system
- Audio alert mechanism
- Edge AI deployment
- Efficient embedded optimization
- Stable real-time performance

8. CONCLUSION
-------------
The Road AI system successfully demonstrates real-time, embedded AI deployment for road safety applications. Through dataset expansion, iterative training, model optimization, and hardware integration, a stable and accurate detection system was achieved on Raspberry Pi 5.

The system represents a complete end-to-end AI engineering pipeline from dataset creation to edge deployment.
